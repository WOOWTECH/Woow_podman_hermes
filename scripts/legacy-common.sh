# shellcheck shell=bash
# scripts/legacy-common.sh: the rollback helpers scripts/migrate-legacy.sh uses to keep the legacy
# containers available (STANDARD 7a). Sourced after scripts/common.sh. Kept out of common.sh on
# purpose: that file is the one this repo shares verbatim with the other Quadlet repos.
#
# Two shapes, decided by ql_rollback_strategy from the host's real state and never from its name:
#
#   rename   podman rename <name> <name>-legacy-<suffix>, left stopped. Safe only while nothing
#            starts it again.
#   capture  ql_capture_container into the backup directory, then a plain `podman rm`. Needed where
#            the user unit podman-restart.service is enabled AND a legacy container's restart policy
#            is exactly `always` - podman 4.9.3 cannot change a policy in place, so a renamed copy
#            would revive at the next boot and fight the new Quadlet container for its name, ports
#            and volumes. None of the three hermes containers is `always` on woowtechopenclaw today
#            (all three are unless-stopped), so that host takes the rename path - but the capture
#            path is fully supported here, and hermes is the stack that needs --commit when it is.
#
# What capture-then-remove cannot preserve is the container's writable layer. LEGACY_COMMIT_ALWAYS
# names the containers whose own deploy or upgrade script writes into the running container, and
# LEGACY_COMMIT_RW_BYTES is the measured size above which any container is committed anyway. Both
# are set in scripts/common.sh, so the decision is per repo, visible, and testable.

# app_unlocked <cmd...>: run <cmd> with the app lock's file descriptor closed.
#
# ql_lock takes the per-app lock with `exec {fd}>"$dir/lock"`, and bash does not mark a descriptor
# opened that way close-on-exec. Every child therefore inherits it - including conmon and
# rootlessport, which outlive the script and keep the flock for as long as the container runs. The
# next install, upgrade, uninstall or --rollback for this app then dies with "another
# install/upgrade/uninstall is running". Verified on toypark1234, where both the emqx and the odoo18
# locks were held by a conmon that had inherited them.
#
# Until quadlet-lib closes that descriptor itself, everything that can start a container runs
# through here. A missing QL_LOCK_FD (no lock taken) just runs the command.
